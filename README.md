  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Move to the root directory with `cd ..` and start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

## Collaborating- use of WaffleBot
  * WaffleBot is a way of keeping track of issue numbers,   progress and collaborators on these.
  * In the Backlog column there are numbers on the top left that reference issue #s.
  * When you create a branch starting with this number, WaffleBot automatically moves it to the In Progress tab, letting people know you are working on a specific issue.
  * After making a pull request with key words such as Fixes, Closes, or Resolves and the issue #, WaffleBot moves the tag again to the right where another collaborator can review it.
