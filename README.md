# ChampionerOne

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Move to the root directory with `cd ..` and start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Collaborating- use of WaffleBot
  * ChampionerOne uses Waffle.io as a project management tool because it allows a high level of cooperation between developers, and collaborators in general.
  * ChampionerOne's [Waffle.io](https://waffle.oi/championer-org/championer_one)
  * WaffleBot keeps track of progress and which collaborators are currently working on an issue by tracking GitHub issue numbers.
  * Everything starts in the Backlog column where there is a list of tags. At the top left, there are numbers that reference GitHub issue #s. If you click on one of them, a short description will help you understand what the issue is.
  * Create a branch starting with this number and a short description, change some code, and when you push to this branch, WaffleBot automatically moves it to the In Progress tab, letting people know you are working on a specific issue.
  * You can always add the tag [WIP] to let people know it's not intended to be finished.
  * After making a pull request with a key word such as Fixes, Closes, or Resolves and the issue #, WaffleBot moves the tag again to the right where another collaborator can review it.
